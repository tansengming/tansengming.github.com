One of the nice things about the software development process at Reading Eggs is the fact that we had the most abso-fucking-lutely boring launches. In the 2+ years I was there we launched [Mathseeds](http://mathseeds.com), [WordFlyers](http://wordflyers.com.au), rewrote the entire teacher interface and had plenty of major features launched in between. Most of the time someone flips a switch, we email customers about the new thing and everyone goes home on time. Then we have BBQ and beer in the park the next day. The one time I had to leave work late on a launch was when Delayed Job choked when we tried to tell everyone about it. It was a pretty simple fix (hint: don't use DJ to send high volume emails). I ended up leaving 10 minutes later than usual.

Sure we had plenty of pre-launch problems. Bugs, changes, delays, arguments over how things should be work[1]. Which really doesn't matter since customers don't get to see any of that. All's great as long as the sausages taste great at the end of it. The secret to make great sausages is as banal as:

- getting competent developers to work on the project,
- have it reviewed at least once by other competent developers,
- Send it out to other parts of the business (editorial, marketing) for review
- write up a test plan and sent it out to an external QA service for testing

All of which wouldn't matter if we didn't have a great team leader who sold the business on flexible launch dates and giving customers the best experience at launch.
