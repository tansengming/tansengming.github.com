While at Knorex, we built a stock watcher, article discovery tool and other data based widgets for Malaysia's largest English newspaper. We supported millions of hits everyday by leaning heavily on Varnish and HTTP load testing. Built with jQuery on a REST backend made from Glassfish and MySQL.

For Freescale Semiconductors I build an application to report and analyze millions of micro-controller test results every month. It also analyzed lot equipment history to detect equipment failures using statistical tests. The main challenge was working with the myriad of data sources and optimizing the analysis to handle the data load. Built with Rails and MySQL with R for statistical work.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What do you do and how long have you been doing it?**
I am a full stack Rails developer, meaning that I've optimized the servers (Apache, Glassfish, Varnish), tuned databases (MySQL) and written application (Ruby, Java) & front end (jQuery, HTML, CSS) code. That said, I'd rather work mostly on application code. I shipped my first Rails application on 2007 (a tiny little app to manage newsletters).

**What projects have you worked on?**
I've worked in manufacturing, building a defect reporting & analysis tool. In finance, building stock readers for the bursa feed and tools to manage stock information. I've also worked on Semantic Technologies and data integration while at [Knorex][knorex].

**What languages have you worked with?**
I work mostly with Ruby but have been known to ship products in jQuery, Java and PHP.
