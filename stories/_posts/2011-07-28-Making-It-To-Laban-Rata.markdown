When I got to Laban Rata I met a couple named Sasha. Meaning that I met a man and a woman in a relationship and were both named Sasha. They offered me hot coffee and light banter but believe me when I say that Iâ€™m not totally sure that the incident really happened.

Just hours ago three friends and I started the hike up Mount Kinabalu and we stayed together for the first few hours. I had left them behind as we got higher. Then the mist came and I heard birdsong from a distance but never see any birds. From behind me I could hear people and a group of dark haired, foreign looking folk, walked single file and passed me while singing and humming in unison. Higher on I saw leafless trees on a barren moss covered rocks, a stark contrast from the rain forest we were in when we started the journey. Everything seemed strange to me.

By the time I reached Laban Rata I was wet, cold wearing only my pants and white tee while everyone else had waterproofed jackets on. I got in found the closest chair and just laid there. Not sure if anything was real. The delirious seldom have the mental capacity to work out reality. Then Sasha and Sasha sat next to me, we had a pleasant chat and I remember asking them how strange it was that they both had the same name. They were surprised that I thought it was unusual. Later on my friends got there and I never saw the couple anymore.
