in Inventing the Truth: The Art and Craft of Memoir,
2d ed., ed. William Zinsser (Boston; New York: Houghton
Mifflin, 1995), 83-102

My inclusion in a series of talks on autobiography and
memoir is not entirely a misalliance. Although it’s probably true that a fiction writer thinks of his or her work as
alien in that company, what I have to say may suggest why
I’m not completely out of place here. For one thing, I
might throw into relief the differences between self-recollection (memoir) and fiction, and also some of the similarities - the places where those two crafts embrace and
where that embrace is symbiotic.

But the authenticity of my presence here lies in the fact
that a very large part of my own literary heritage is the
autobiography. In this country the print origins of black
literature (as distinguished from the oral origins) were
slave narratives. These book-length narratives (autobiographies, recollections, memoirs), of which well over a
hundred were published, are familiar texts to historians
and students of black history. They range from the adventure-packed life of Olaudah Equiano’s The Interesting Narrative of the Life ofOlaudah Equiano, or Gustavus T-‘lJssa, the
African, Written by Himself(r769) to the quiet desperation
of Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl: Written by Herself
(r86r), in which Harriet Jacob (“Linda Brent”) records
hiding for seven years in a room too small to stand up in;
from the political savvy of Frederick Douglass’s Narrative
of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Written
by Himself(r84S) to the subtlety and modesty of Henry
Bibb, whose voice, in Life and Adventures ofHenry Bibb, an
American Slave, Written by Himself (1849), is surrounded
by (“loaded with” is a better phrase) documents attesting
to its authenticity. Bibb is careful to note that his formal
schooling (three weeks) was short, but that he was “educated in the school of adversity, whips, and chains.” Born
in Kentucky, he put aside his plans to escape in order to
marry. But when he learned that he was the father of a
slave and watched the degradation of his wife and child, he
reactivated those plans.

Whatever the style and circumstances of these narratives, they were written to say principally two things. One:
“This is my historical life - my singular, special example
that is personal, but that also represents the race.” Two: “I
write this text to persuade other people - you, the reader,
who is probably not black - that we are human beings
worthy of God’s grace and the immediate abandonment of
slavery.” With these two missions in mind, the narratives
were clearly pointed.

In Equiano’s account, the purpose is quite up-front.
Born in 1745 near the Niger River and captured at the age of ten, he survived the Middle Passage, American plantation slavery, wars in Canada and the Mediterranean;
learned navigation and clerking from a Quaker named
Robert King, and bought his freedom at twenty-one. He
lived as a free servant, traveling widely and living most
of his latter life in England. Here he is speaking to the
British without equivocation: “I hope to have the satisfaction of seeing the renovation of liberty and justice resting
on the British government
1 hope and expect the attention of gentlemen of power
May the time come - at
least the speculation is to me pleasing - when the sable
people shall gratefully commemorate the auspicious era
of extensive freedom.” With typically eighteenth-century
reticence he records his singular and representative life for
one purpose: to change things. In fact, he and his
coauthors did change things. Their works gave fuel to the
fires that abolitionists were setting everywhere.

More difficult was getting the fair appraisal of literary
critics. The writings of church martyrs and confessors are
and were read for the eloquence of their message as well as
their experience of redemption, but the American slaves'
autobiographical narratives were frequently scorned as "biased," "inflammatory" and "improbable." These attacks are
particularly difficult to understand in view of the fact that it
was extremely important, as you can imagine, for the writers
of these narratives to appear as objective as possible - not
to offend the reader by being too angry; or by showing too
much outrage, or by calling the reader names. As recently as
1966, Paul Edwards, who edited and abridged Equianos
story, praises the narrative for its refusal to be "inflammatory."

"As a rule," Edwards writes, "he [Equiano] puts no
emotional pressure on the reader other than that which
the situation itself contains - his language does not strain
after our sympathy, but expects it to be given naturally and
at the proper time. This quiet avoidance of emotional
display produces many of the best passages in the book."
Similarly, an r836 review of Charles Bell's Life and Adventures ofa Fugitive Slave, which appeared in the "Quarterly
Anti-Slavery Magazine," praised Bell's account for its objectivity. "We rejoice in the book the more, because it is
not a partisan work. ... It broaches no theory in regard to
[slavery], nor proposes any mode or time of emancipation."

As determined as these black writers were to persuade the
reader of the evil of slavery, they also complimented him
by assuming his nobility of heart and his high-mindedness.
They tried to summon up his finer nature in order to
encourage him to employ it. They knew that their readers
were the people who could make a difference in terminating slavery. Their stories - of brutality, adversity and deliverance - had great popularity in spite of critical hostility in many quarters and patronizing sympathy in others.
There was a time when the hunger for "slave stories" was
difficult to quiet, as sales figures show. Douglass's Narrative sold five thousand copies in four months; by r847 it
had sold eleven thousand copies. Equianos book had thirty six editions between r789 and r850. Moses Roper's book
had ten editions from r837 to r856; 'William Wells Browns
was reprinted four times in its first year. Solomon Northrop's book sold twenty-seven thousand copies before two
years had passed. A book by Josiah Henson (argued by some to be the model for the "Tom" of Harriet Beecher
Stowe's Uncle 10m's Cabin) had a pre-publication sale of
five thousand.

In addition to using their own lives to expose the horrors of slavery, they had a companion motive for their
efforts. The prohibition against teaching a slave to read
and write (which in many Southern states carried severe
punishment) and against a slave's learning to read and
write had to be scuttled at all costs. These writers knew
that literacy was power. Voting, after all, was inextricably
connected to the ability to read; literacy was a way of
assuming and proving the "humanity" that the Constitution denied them. That is why the narratives carry the
subtitle "written by himself," or "herself," and include
introductions and prefaces by white sympathizers to authenticate them. Other narratives, "edited by" such wellknown anti-slavery figures as Lydia Maria Child and John
Greenleaf Whittier, contain prefaces to assure the reader
how little editing was needed. A literate slave was supposed to be a contradiction in terms.

One has to remember that the climate in which they ,
wrote reflected not only the Age of Enlightenment but its
twin, born at the same time, the Age of Scientific Racism.
David Hume, Immanuel Kant and Thomas Jefferson, to
mention only a few, had documented their conclusions that
blacks were incapable of intelligence. Frederick Douglass
knew otherwise, and he wrote refutations of what Jefferson
said in "Notes on the State of Virginia": "Never yet could
I find that a black had uttered a thought above the level
of plain narration, never see even an elementary trait of painting or sculpture" - a sentence that I have always
thought ought to be engraved at the door to the Rockefeller Collection ofAfrican Art. Hegel, in 1813, had said that
Africans had no "history" and couldn't write in modem
languages. Kant disregarded a perceptive observation by a
black man by saying, "This fellow was quite black from
head to foot, a clear proof that what he said was stupid."

Yet no slave society in the history of the world wrote
more - or more thoughtfully - about its own enslavement. The milieu, however, dictated the purpose and the
style. The narratives are instructive, moral and obviously
representative. Some of them are patterned after the sentimental novel that was in vogue at the time. But whatever
the level of eloquence or t:h~ form, popular taste discouraged the writers from dwelling too long or too carefully
on the more sordid details of their experience. Whenever
there was an unusually violent incident, or a scatological
one, or something "excessive," one finds the writer taking
refuge in the literary conventions of the day. "I was left in
a state of distraction not to be described" (Equiano). "But
let us now leave the rough usage of the field ... and tum
our attention to the less repulsive slave life as it existed in
the house of my childhood" (Douglass). "I am not about
to harrow the feelings of my readers by a terrific representation of the untold horrors of that fearful system of
oppression. . . . It is not my purpose to descend deeply
into the dark and noisome caverns of the hell of slavery"
(Henry Box Brown).

Over and over, the writers pull the narrative up short
with a phrase such as, "But let us drop a veil over these
proceedings too terrible to relate." In shaping the experience to make it palatable to those who were in a position
to alleviate it, they were silent about many things, and
they "forgot" many other things. There was a careful selection of the instances that they would record and a careful rendering of those that they chose to describe. Lydia
Maria Child identified the problem in her introduction to
"Linda Brent's" tale of sexual abuse: "I am well aware that
many will accuse me of indecorum for presenting these
pages to the public; for the experiences of this intelligent
and much-injured woman belong to a class which some
call delicate subjects, and others indelicate. This peculiar
phase of Slavery has generally been kept veiled; but the
public ought to be made acquainted with its monstrous
features, and I am willing to take the responsibility of
presenting them with the veil drawn [aside]."

But most importantly - at least for me - there was no
mention of their interior life.

For me - a writer in the last quarter of the twentieth
century, not much more than a hundred years after Emancipation, a writer who is black and a woman - the exercise is very different. My job becomes how to rip that veil
drawn over "proceedings too terrible to relate." The exercise is also critical for any person who is black, or who
belongs to any marginalized category, for, historically, we
were seldom invited to participate in the discourse even
when we were its topic.

Moving that veil aside requires, therefore, certain things.
First of all, I must trust my own recollections. I must also
depend on the recollections of others. Thus memory weighs
heavily in what I write, in how I begin and in what I find to
be significant. Zora Neale Hurston said, "Like the deads eeming cold rocks, I have memories within that came out
of the material that went to make me." These "memories
within" are the subsoil of my work. But memories and
recollections won't give me total access to the unwritten
interior life of these people. Only the act of the imagination can help me.

If writing is thinking and discovery and selection and order and meaning, it is also awe and reverence and mystery
and magic. I suppose I could dispense with the last four if!
were not so deadly serious about fidelity to the milieu out
of which I write and in which my ancestors actually lived.
Infidelity to that milieu - the absence of the interior life,
the deliberate excising of it from the records that the
slaves themselves told - is precisely the problem in the
discourse that proceeded without us. How I gain access to
that interior life is what drives me and is the part of this
talk which both distinguishes my fiction from autobiographical strategies and which also embraces certain autobiographical strategies. It's a kind of literary archeology:
On the basis of some information and a little bit of guesswork you journey to a site to see what remains were left
behind and to reconstruct the world that these remains
imply. What makes it fiction is the nature of the imaginative act: my reliance on the image - on the remains - in
addition to recollection, to yield up a kind of a truth. By
"image," of course, I don't mean "symbol"; I simply mean
"picture" and the feelings that accompany the picture.

Fiction, by definition, is distinct from fact. Presumably
its the product of imagination - invention - and it claims
the freedom to dispense with "what really happened," or
where it really happened, or when it really happened, and
nothing in it needs to be publicly verifiable, although much
in it can be verified. By contrast, the scholarship of the
biographer and the literary critic seems to us only trustworthy when the events of fiction can be traced to some
publicly verifiable fact. It's the research of the "Oh, yes,
this is where he or she got it from" school, which gets its
own credibility from excavating the credibility of the sources
of the imagination, not the nature of the imagination.

The work that I do frequently falls, in the minds of
most people, into that realm of fiction called fantastic, or
mythic, or magical, or unbelievable. I'm not comfortable
with these labels. I consider that my single gravest responsibility (in spite of that magic) is not to lie. When I hear
someone say, "Truth is stranger than fiction," I think that
old chestnut is truer than we know, because it doesn't say
that truth is truer than fiction; just that it's stranger, meaning that it's odd. It may be excessive, it may be more
interesting, but the important thing is that it's random and fiction is not random.

Therefore the crucial distinction for me is not the difference between fact and fiction, but the distinction between fact and truth. Because facts can exist without human intelligence, but truth cannot. So if I'm looking to
find and expose a truth about the interior life of people
who didn't write it (which doesn't mean that they didn't
have it); if I'm trying to fill in the blanks that the slave narratives left - to part the veil that was so frequently
drawn, to implement the stories that I heard - then the
approach that's most productive and most trustworthy for
me is the recollection that moves from the image to the
text. Not from the text to the image.

Simone de Beauvoir, in _A Very Easy Death_, says, "I don't
know why I was so shocked by my mother's death." When
she heard her mother's name being called at the funeral by
the priest, she says, "Emotion seized me by the throat....
'Francoise de Beauvoir'; the words brought her to life;
they summed up her history, from birth to marriage to
widowhood to the grave. Francoise de Beauvoir - that
retiring woman, so rarely named, became an important
person." The book becomes an exploration both into her
own grief and into the images in which the grief lay buried.

Unlike Mme. de Beauvoir, Frederick Douglass asks the
reader's patience for spending about half a page on the
death of his grandmother - easily the most profound loss
he had suffered - and he apologizes by saying, in effect,
"It really was very important to me. I hope you aren't
bored by my indulgence." He makes no attempt to explore that death: its images or its meaning. His narrative is
as close to factual as he can make it, which leaves no room
for subjective speculation. James Baldwin, on the other
hand, in Notes of a Native Son, says, in recording his father's
life and his own relationship to his father, "All of my father's Biblical texts and songs, which I had decided were
meaningless, were ranged before me at his death like
empty bottles, waiting to hold the meaning which life
would give them for me." And then his text fills those
bottles. Like Simone de Beauvoir, he moves from the
event to the image that it left. My route is the reverse: The
image comes first and tells me what the "memory" is about.

I can't tell you how I felt when my father died. But I was
able to write Song of Solomon and imagine, not him, and
not his specific interior life, but the world that he inhabited and the private or interior life of the people in it.
And I can't tell you how I felt reading to my grandmother
while she was turning over and over in her bed (because
she was dying, and she was not comfortable), but I could
try to reconstruct the world that she lived in. And I have
suspected, more often than not, that I know more than she
did, that I know more than my grandfather and my great grandmother did, but I also know that I'm no wiser than
they were. And whenever I have tried earnestly to diminish their vision and prove to myself that I know more, and
when I have tried to speculate on their interior life and
match it up with my own, I have been overwhelmed every
time by the richness of theirs compared to my own. Like
Frederick Douglass talking about his grandmother, and
James Baldwin talking about his father, and Simone de
Beauvoir talking about her mother, these people are my
access to me; they are my entrance into my own interior
life. Which is why the images that float around them the remains, so to speak, at the archaeological site - surface first, and they surface so vividly and so compellingly
that I acknowledge them as my route to a reconstruction
of a world, to an exploration of an interior life that was not
written and to the revelation of a kind of truth.

So the nature of my research begins with something as ineffable and as flexible as a dimly recalled figure, the
comer of a room, a voice. I began to write my second
book, which was called Sula, because of my preoccupation
with a picture of a woman and the way in which I heard
her name pronounced. Her name was Hannah, and I
think she was a friend of my mother's. I don't remember
seeing her very much, but what I do remember is the color
around her - a kind of violet, a suffusion of something
violet - and her eyes, which appeared to be half closed.
But what I remember most is how the women said her
name: how they said "Hannah Peace" and smiled to themselves, and there was some secret about her that they
knew, which they didn't talk about, at least not in my
hearing, but it seemed loaded in the way in which they said
her name. And I suspected that she was a little bit of an
outlaw but that they approved in some way.

And then, thinking about their relationship to her and
the way in which they talked about her, the way in which
they articulated her name, made me think about friendship between women. What is it that they forgive each
other for? And what it is that is unforgivable in the world
of women. I don't want to know any more about Miss
Hannah Peace, and I'm not going to ask my mother who
she really was and what did she do and what were you
laughing about and why were you smiling? Because my
experience when I do this with my mother is so crushing:
She will give you the most pedestrian information you
ever heard, and I would like to keep all of my remains and
my images intact in their mystery when I begin. Later I
will get to the facts. That way I can explore two worlds the actual and the possible.

What I want to do in this talk is to track an image from
picture to meaning to text - a journey which appears in
the novel that I'm writing now, which is called Beloved.

I'm trying to write a particular kind of scene, and I see
corn on the cob. To "see" corn on the cob doesn't mean
that it suddenly hovers; it only means that it keeps coming
back. And in trying to figure out "What is all this corn
doing?" I discover what it is doing.

I see the house where I grew up in Lorain, Ohio. My
parents had a garden some distance away from our house,
and they didn't welcome me and my sister there, when we
were young, because we were not able to distinguish between the things that they wanted to grow and the things
that they didn't, so we were not able to hoe, or weed, until
much later.

I see them walking, together, away from me. I'm looking at their backs and what they're carrying in their arms:
their tools, and maybe a peck basket. Sometimes when
they walk away from me they hold hands, and they go to
this other place in the garden. They have to cross some
railroad tracks to get there.

I also am aware that my mother and father sleep at odd
hours because my father works many jobs and works at
night. And these naps are times of pleasure for me and my
sister because nobody's giving us chores, or telling us what
to do, or nagging us in any way. In addition to which,
there is some feeling of pleasure in them that I'm only vaguely aware of. They're very rested when they take
these naps.

And later on in the summer we have an opportunity to
eat corn, which is the one plant that I can distinguish from
the others, and which is the harvest that I like the best; the
others are the food that no child likes - the collards, the
okra, the strong, violent vegetables that I would give a
great deal for now. But I do like the corn because it's sweet,
and because we all sit down to eat it, and it's finger food,
and it's hot, and it's even good cold, and there are neighbors in, and there are uncles in, and it's easy, and it's nice.

The picture of the corn and the nimbus of emotion
surrounding it became a powerful one in the manuscript
I'm now completing.

Authors arrive at text and subtext in thousands of ways,
learning each time they begin anew how to recognize a
valuable idea and how to render the texture that accompanies, reveals or displays it to its best advantage. The process by which this is accomplished is endlessly fascinating
to me. I have always thought that as an editor for twenty
years I understood writers better than their most careful
critics, because in examining the manuscript in each of its
subsequent stages I knew the author's process, how his or
her mind worked, what was effortless, what took time,
where the "solution" to a problem came from. The end
result - the book - was all that the critic had to go on.

Still, for me, that was the least important aspect of the
work. Because, no matter how "fictional" the account of
these writers, or how much it was a product of invention,
the act of imagination is bound up with memory. You
know, they straightened out the Mississippi River in
places, to make room for houses and livable acreage. Occasionally the river floods these places. "Floods" is the
word they use, but in fact it is not flooding; it is remembering. Remembering where it used to be. All water has a
perfect memory and is forever trying to get back to where
it was. Writers are like that: remembering where we were,
what valley we ran through, what the banks were like, the
light that was there and the route back to our original
place. It is emotional memory - what the nerves and the
skin remember as well as how it appeared. And a rush of
imagination is our "flooding."

Along with personal recollection, the matrix of the work I
do is the wish to extend, fill in and complement slave
autobiographical narratives. But only the matrix. What
comes of all that is dictated by other concerns, not least
among them the novel's own integrity. Still, like water, I
remember where I was before I was "straightened out."

Q. I would like to ask about your point of view as a
novelist. Is it a vision, or are you taking the part of the
particular characters?

I try sometimes to have genuinely minor characters just
walk through, like a walk-on actor. But I get easily distracted by them, because a novelist's imagination goes like
that: Every little road looks to me like an adventure, and
once you begin to claim it and describe it, it looks like
more, and you invent more and more and more. I don't
mind doing that in my first draft, but afterward I have to cut back. I have seen myself get distracted, and people
have loomed much larger than I had planned, and minor
characters have seemed a little bit more interesting than
they need to be for the purposes of the book. In that case I
try to endow them: If there are little pieces of information
that I want to reveal, I let them do some of the work. But I
try not to get carried away; I try to restrain it, so that,
finally, the texture is consistent and nothing is wasted;
there are no words in the final text that are unnecessary,
and no people who are not absolutely necessary.

As for the point of view, there should be the illusion that
it's the characters' point of view, when in fact it isn't; its
really the narrator who is there but who doesn't make
herself (in my case) known in that role. I like the feeling of
a told story, where you hear a voice but you can't identify it,
and you think its your own voice. It's a comfortable voice,
and it's a guiding voice, and it's alarmed by the same things
that the reader is alarmed by, and it doesn't know what's
going to happen next either. So you have this sort of
guide. But that guide can't have a personality; it can only
have a sound, and you have to feel comfortable with this
voice, and then this voice can easily abandon itself and
reveal the interior dialogue of a character. So it's a combination of using the point of view of various characters but
still retaining the power to slide in and out, provided that
when I'm "out" the reader doesn't see little fingers pointing to what's in the text.

What I really want is that intimacy in which the reader
is under the impression that he isn't really reading this;
that he is participating in it as he goes along. It's unfolding, and he's always two beats ahead of the characters and
right on target.

Q. You have said that writing is a solitary activity. Do
you go into steady seclusion when you're writing, so that
your feelings are sort of contained, or do you have to get
away, and go out shopping and ... ?

I do all of it. I've been at this book for three years. I go
out shopping, and I stare, and I do whatever. It goes away.
Sometimes it's very intense and I walk - I mean, I write a
sentence and I jump up and run outside or something; it
sort of beats you up. And sometimes I don't. Sometimes I
write long hours every day. I get up at 5:30 and just go do
it, and if I don't like it the next day, I throw it away. But
I sit down and do it. By now I know how to get to that
place where something is working. I didn’t always know; I
thought every thought I had was interesting x- because it
was mine. Now I know better how to throwaway things
that are not useful. I can stand around and do other things
and think about it at the same time. I don’t mind not
writing every minute; I’m not so terrified.

When you first start writing - and I think its true for a
lot of beginning writers - you’re scared to death that if
you don’t get that sentence right that minute it’s never
going to show up again. And it isn’t. But it doesn’t matter - another one will, and it’ll probably be better. And I
don’t mind writing badly for a couple of days because I
know I can fix it - and fix it again and again and again,
and it will be better. I don’t have the hysteria that used to
accompany some of those dazzling passages that I thought
the world was just dying for me to remember. I’m a little more sanguine about it now. Because the best part of it all,
the absolutely most delicious part, is finishing it and then
doing it over. That’s the thrill of a lifetime for me: if I can
just get done with that first phase and then have infinite
time to :fix it and change it. I rewrite a lot, over and over
again, so that it looks like I never did. I try to make it look
like I never touched it, and that takes a lot of time and a lot
of sweat.

Q. In Song of Solomon, what was the relationship between your memories and what you made up? Was it very
tenuous?

Yes, it was tenuous. For the first time I was writing a
book in which the central stage was occupied by men, and
which had something to do with my loss, or my perception of loss, of a man (my father) and the world that disappeared with him. (It didn’t, but I felt that it did.) So I was
re-creating a time period that was his - not biographically his life or anything in it; I use whatever's around. But
it seemed to me that there was this big void after he died,
and I filled it with a book that was about men because my
two previous books had had women as the central characters. So in that sense it was about my memories and the
need to invent. I had to do something. I was in such a rage
because my father was dead. The connections between us
were threads that I either mined for a lot of strength or
they were purely invention. But I created a male world
and inhabited it and it had this quest - a journey from
stupidity to epiphany, of a man, a complete man. It was my
way of exploring all that, of trying to figure out what he
may have known.
